This repository contains data and code used in the analysis of SNCA.

The following files should be used to run the analysis:
- TQanalysis.jl: Perform experiments using data from a tandem queueing simualtion.
- WFanalysis.jl: Perform experiments using data from a wafer fab simualtion.
- figures.jl: Generate figures from results of the previous two files.
